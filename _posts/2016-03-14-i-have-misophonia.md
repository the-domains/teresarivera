# I have Misophonia. 

# So?

# I didn't know what it was until a few years ago either.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/efa78f77-41ea-4d82-9eec-58b7839cb25a.jpg)

> Do you have an intense emotional reaction to hearing someone eating with their mouth open, sneezing, coughing, sniffling, chewing or throat-clearing? Do you feel enraged when you hear repetitive noises like tapping, the clicking of a pen, typing on a keyboard, crunchy foods being chewed or hearing other sounds that make you want to run away or lash out at the source of the sound? Have you wondered why you experience such reactions and sensitivities and wonder if you are the only one who has these problems? When your _trigger events _occur, does it seem like other people don't take any notice of the sounds that affect you so strongly? Guess what... You're not alone."

That is the first paragraph of the website that is linked [here][0].  The remainder of the article talks about a disorder most people don't know about.  It's called Misophonia, pronounced me-so-fone-e-ah.  In medical jargon translation it means "hatred of sound".  I think that's a little misleading, because it's not ALL sounds.  It's sounds that fall within specific decibels or categories (what we called triggers).  I love music. I love the sound of the ocean, I love my children's voices, etc.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b1ff626c-2a17-499e-a4aa-a09a7db39c34.jpg)

But the sounds that I do hate?  Oh boy ... that's a long list!  You can find the entire list of triggers [here][1].  I have most of them.

This is me

This is how I feel when I'm triggered

This is what I'm thinking

So, here's the story:  (add later)

I think I found something that will help though.  These amazing new bluetooth ear buds.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/53ec62b1-ce3d-4109-a730-d9e48c283958.png)

They're called [Here Active Listening][2] and I just got a pair two weeks ago.  I was on the wait list for over 6 months.  While they weren't created specifically to help people with Misophonia, I am here to tell you, they've created something so absolutely inspiring, I have hope again that my life can be "almost" normal. 

What are they?

**_My goal with this site to bring awareness about Misophonia.  I'll share recent and informative articles that can help other people with this disorder, post  stories from sufferers like me and from their friends and family who have to live with them/me and maybe just laugh a little at myself. This is a disorder that makes you feel powerless.  And because there is no know cure yet, laughter can help.  I think. _**

Before I knew that I had this disorder, there were signs.  For instance, I used to manage a team of salespeople and we all shared an office together.  It was torture for me because of all the sounds that were made ALL DAY LONG that triggered me.  I thought I was crazy.  But I wanted the sounds to go away and I had to be "nice" about it.  So I posted this on the sales board: (insert TTUBR here).
